## Contributing to the course repository

To contribute you'll need to start off by forking the course repository.  To do that login to https://github.com and then go to https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails. Once you get to the course repository you will see a button in the top right called "Fork". Click the fork button and one of two things will happen.  One you will see a popup asking where you want to fork the repository too, or two you will see a message about forking the repository to your account.

Once you have forked the course repository you will see something like the following figure, where your username is in front of `madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails`

Next you can either clone the repository and use your text editor of choice, or you can edit the files you want to change in the browser.  For this example we're just going to edit in the browser. Find the file you want to edit and click on it.

Once the file is open click on the pencil icon to edit the file in the browser.

Make your changes then scroll to the bottom. Fill out the commit message, create a new branch so that you keep things separate. It may seem like extra overhead but it is good practice. When you are happy with your commit message click "Propose file change"

That will take you to an open a pull request screen where you will want to make sure you set things up correctly.  First make sure you can compare to the `johnsonchmatc` base.  To do that you may need to click on the "compare across forks" link which will toggle the repository dropdowns.  The base should be `johnsonchmatc` and `master`. The head fork should be yours and the branch you just made.
