## Projects

There are fifteen units in the course. For each four to five units there will
be a project worth 20 points. The projects will always be due by the next
class period after the last unit for that project is finished.
The projects will be submitted electronically as a zipped (compressed) archive
through the course Blackboard website. Instructions for zipping and submitting
your projects are addressed in another course document.
</p>

An individual instructor may have a different submission prodecure
which supersedes this one.
