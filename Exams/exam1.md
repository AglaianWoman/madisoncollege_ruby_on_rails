##Description
For exam 1 you will choose a topic to present to the class.  You will choose a random number to determine the order in which you pick a topic.

Once a topic has been picked it will no longer be available.  

Your presentation will consist of two parts.  The first is answering the 'What is' portion of the question with a response from either the book or the lectures but crafted into your own words.  The second part will require some research, answer the question with at least 1 source.

Your presentation will need to at least 3 minutes long and ideally not exceeding 5 minutes.

The goal of this exam is to put you in the situation of sharing some information with your co-learners as you would on the job.
