#Chapter 1

---
#What is Ruby?

> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

---
#What is Rails
> Ruby on Rails is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.

---
#Ruby version Managers
* Tools to allow you to install several versions of Ruby side by side
* Popular ones are: RVM, rbenv and chruby.

---
#What are Gems (RubyGems)?
>RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.

---
#The Gem command
* ```$ man gem```
* ```$ gem install <gem name> -v=<gem version>```
* ```$ gem list````
* ```$ gem uninstall <gem name>```

---
#Configuration Files
##AKA 'Dot' files

---
#Dot Files
* Start with a ```.``` so they are 'hidden'
* Can be used to configure many applications

---
#.gemrc
```
install: --no-rdoc --no-ri
update:  --no-rdoc --no-ri
```
* This says don't install ri or rdoc when installing a gem
* If you *need* docs locally remove these

---
#```$ rails new```

---
```
$ rails new first_app
      create
      create  README.rdoc
      create  Rakefile
      create  config.ru
      create  .gitignore
      create  Gemfile
      create  app
      create  app/assets/javascripts/application.js
      create  app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
      create  app/controllers/application_controller.rb
      .
      .
      .
      create  vendor/assets/stylesheets/.keep
         run  bundle install
```

---
#Let's explore what files are generated
---
#Instructor opinion
Add the ```--skip-bundle``` flag at the end of your generation command.  It allows your app to be generated and you to make changes before installing gems.

---
#Bundler
>Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as ```bundle install```.

---
#Bundler
Makes use of two files:
* Gemfile
* Gemfile.lock

---
#Gemfile
* A list of all your application's required Gems
* Bundler uses this to manage which Gems to load
* [http://bundler.io/v1.2/man/gemfile.5.html](http://bundler.io/v1.2/man/gemfile.5.html)
* Allows you to group gems for what they are used for ie. Test, Development, Production

---
##Gemfile.lock
* A snapshot from when you run bundle install.  
* Not the best idea to modify by hand!

---
#Bundler
* ```$ bundle help```
* ```$ bundle install``` installs gems
* ```$ bundle check``` checks to see if Gemfile is satisfied
* [http://bundler.io/v1.7/commands.html](http://bundler.io/v1.7/commands.html)

---
#Rails server
* ```$ bundle exec rails server ```
> on cloud 9 add ```-b $IP -p $PORT```

---
#MVC

---
##Model
* Responsible for maintaining the state of the application
* Enforcing business rules

---
##View
* User interface

---
##Controller
* Orchestrate the application (Traffic Cop)

---
#What is REST?
> Representational State Transfer 

* Simple set of Verbs that work on each Noun of an application.

--- 
#What is a 'resource'?
* Simply a controller 
* Scaffolding creates a 1 to 1 relationship to model
* Does not need to reflect a model 
* Defaults to REST actions

---
#What is 'scaffolding'
* Generated by the ```scaffold``` command
* Generates code based on the attribute notation ```name:string```
* Creates model, view, controller, helper, route, migration and tests
* Has default basic code

---
#Example Route

```
DemoApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :users
end
```

---
#$ rake routes

```
Prefix    Verb   URI Pattern                    Controller#Action
users     GET    /users(.:format)               users#index
          POST   /users(.:format)               users#create
new_user  GET    /users/new(.:format)           users#new
edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format)      users#edit
users     GET    /users/:id(.:format)           users#show
          PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)           users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)           users#destroy
```
^Maps to CRUD actions (index,show,new,create,edit,update,destroy)

---
##PUT vs PATCH
* PATCH is like PUT however PUT works on the full dataset where as PATCH only requires the delta.
* PATCH was defined in 1995 and adopted into Rails in version 4.0

---
##Sample update request
```
started PATCH "/users/1" for 50.50.89.28 at 2014-12-26 12:22:13 +0000
Processing by UsersController#update as HTML

  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]

#Preparing for the demo today

* Note: make sure you have removed 'wolfies_list' if you generated one last week.
* ```$ git clone git@github.com:johnsonch/wolfies_list.git ```
* ```$ cd wolfies_list```
* ```$ bundle install --path=vendor/bundle```

#Demo

^ Clean up Heroku messes
- delete from heroko
- remove from git config
- ```$ heroku create```

^ Scaffold ads
```
$ bundle exec rails g scaffold Ads title:string description:text price:float address:string
```
Scaffold categories
```
$ bundle exec rails g scaffold Categories name:string 
```
Add relationship
- generate migration ```bundle exec rails g migration add_category_id_to_ads```
- add relationships to models

#Active Record Relationships

---
##Active Record Relationships
* belongs_to
* has_many
* has_many_through

---
##Validations
* Rules to prevent invalid data from being saved
* Can be conditional
* Provides error messages back to the controller
* [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers)

---
##Rails Console
* Let's you try out code against 
* ```$ bundle exec rails console```

##Configuring Git
* See what is in your git config file ```cat ~/.gitconfig```
```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```
* ```cat ~/.gitconfig```
