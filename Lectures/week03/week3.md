##What is a 'resource'?
* Simply a controller
* Defaults to REST actions

```
DemoApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :microposts
  resources :users
end
```

^Maps to CRUD actions (index,show,new,create,edit,update,destroy)

---
##What is 'scaffolding'
* Generated by the ```scaffold``` command
* Generates code based on the attribute notation ```name:string```
* Creates model, view, controller, helper, route, migration and tests
* Has default basic code

---
##Rake
* Ruby make
* ```$ bundle exec rake -vT```

---
#Let's take a tour

---
#Active Record Relationships

---
##Active Record Relationships
* belongs_to
* has_many
* has_many_through

---
##Validations
* Rules to prevent invalid data from being saved
* Can be conditional
* Provides error messages back to the controller
* [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers)

---
##Rails Console
* Let's you try out code against 
* ```$ bundle exec rails console```

#Break

---
#Chapter 3

---
#Mostly Static pages, with some Ruby

---
##ERB
* Templating DSL
* Can be used for a variety of things, anything you would want to interpolate with ruby

---
#ERB Demo

---
#Rspec
##Behavior Driven Development

---
#BDD vs TDD

---
##BDD vs TDD
* Both describe an approach to development that focus on testing driving your development
* BDD focuses on testing the Behavior of an application
* BDD in Rails land tends to be RSpec
* TDD focuses on asserting method output 
* TDD in Rails land tends to be Test Unit or MiniTest
* When interviewing for a job talk about the testing framework you used

---
#Example

---
##Code to test

```
def is_palindrome?(word)
  word == word.reverse
end
```

---
##MiniTest
```
test "otto is a palindrome" do
  assert is_palindrome?('otto')
exit

test "stuff is not a palindrome" do
  assert_not is_palindrome?('stuff')
exit
```

---
##RSpec
```
describe '#is_palindrome?' do
  it 'returns true for the word otto' do
    expect(is_palindrome?('otto').to eql true 
  end

  it 'does not return true for the word stuff' do
    expect(is_palindrome?('stuff').to_not eql true 
  end
end
```

---
#Exercise
##BDD Fizzbuzz

---
##Fizzbuzz
* Loop from 1 to 100
* If the number is divisible by 3 output Fizz
* If the number is divisible by 5 output Buzz
* If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 output FizzBuzz
