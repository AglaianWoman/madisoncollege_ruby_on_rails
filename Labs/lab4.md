Notes:
* Generate a controller and an action that you can reference from the routes file
* For help and as a guide reference Chapter 5 from the book for adding bootstrap.
* Also use the YouTube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPC4db13nt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPC4db13nt8) as help/reference, it shows making a welcome controller and index action. About 12:45 into the video.
* Hint you will need to either download or reference a stylesheet from http://bootswatch.com

* Tag what you would like graded with ```to-grade-lab02```
